I've had this project on my PC for a while, and it still works to this day so I decided to share it   
I've used it for a bit on an alt and haven't been banned, but can't guarantee it's VAC safe forever  
This is not mine, the original project is from some guy on UC but I don't remember where I got the source from   

There are 2 versions, one of them has junk code in it to *possibly* make it more VAC safe(from what I've heard) but I can't guarantee it actually does work
   
  
# Usage
Just run *run.bat*  
if the PlayerBase stops working I may make a tutorial on how to get it
